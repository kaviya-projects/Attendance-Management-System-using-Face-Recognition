# Attendance-Management-System-using-Face-Recognition
The Attendance Management System using Face Recognition project aims to automate the attendance marking process by using face recognition technology. Traditional attendance methods, such as manual entry or ID-based systems, are often prone to errors and are time-consuming. This system eliminates those inefficiencies by employing computer vision techniques to identify and verify individuals in real-time.


The system works by capturing live images, detecting faces, and matching them against a pre-registered database of students or employees. Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and other machine learning algorithms, it ensures accurate recognition even under varying lighting conditions or partial occlusion. The attendance is recorded automatically once a match is found, significantly reducing human intervention and preventing proxy attendance.


The implementation of the system ensures greater accuracy, saves time, and provides a more secure alternative to traditional methods. It is particularly useful in educational institutions and corporate settings, where managing attendance manually can be cumbersome and error-prone.


Overall, this project demonstrates how face recognition can streamline administrative tasks, offering an efficient solution for attendance management. Future improvements could include mobile or cloud integration, further enhancing accessibility and scalability.
